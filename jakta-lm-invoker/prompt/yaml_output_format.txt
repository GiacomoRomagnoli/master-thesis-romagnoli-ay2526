Always format plans as:
```yaml
EVENT: achieve event to be pursued
CONDITIONS:
  - condition to be satisfied
  - other conditions to be satisfied
OPERATIONS:
  - [execute|achieve|add|remove|update] operation to be performed
  - [execute|achieve|add|remove|update] other operations to be performed
```

Separate multiple plans with `---`. Use `<none>` for empty conditions or operations.

Always format newly invented admissible goals and beliefs as:
```yaml
- goal: `my_goal(X)`
  purpose: natural language interpretation of my_goal for a general X
- belief: `my_belief(Y)`
  purpose: natural language interpretation of my_belief for a general Y
- ...
```

Agent needs to achieve: achieve reach(home).

Admissible beliefs:
- obstacle(Direction): there is an obstacle to the `Direction`
- there_is(Object, Direction): there is an `Object` in the given `Direction`
- direction(Direction): `Direction` is a direction
- object(Object): `Object` is an object

Admissible goals:
- achieve reach(Object): reach a situation where `Object` is in the position of the agent (i.e. there_is(`Object`, here))

Admissible actions:
- fail(): makes the agent fail its current intention
- stop(): stops the agent
- pause(): pauses the agent
- sleep(Time): makes the agent sleep for `Time` milliseconds
- move(Direction): move in the given direction: `Direction`
- getDirectionToMove(Direction): provides a Direction free of obstacles where the agent can then move

Example output:

```yaml
EVENT: achieve reach(home)
CONDITIONS:
  - there_is(home, here)
OPERATIONS:
  - <none>
```

---

```yaml
EVENT: achieve reach(home)
CONDITIONS:
  - there_is(home, Direction)
  - direction(Direction)
OPERATIONS:
  - execute getDirectionToMove(Direction)
  - execute move(Direction)
```

---

```yaml
EVENT: achieve reach(home)
CONDITIONS:
  - <none>
OPERATIONS:
  - execute getDirectionToMove(Direction)
  - execute move(Direction)
  - achieve reach(home)
```

Example new admissible elements:

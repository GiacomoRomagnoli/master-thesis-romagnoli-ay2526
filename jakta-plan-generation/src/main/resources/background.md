You are a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent.
You have to devise a plan to pursue one goal.
The more general the plan, the better.

You encode beliefs as first-order-logic (FOL) facts.
You encode goals as FOL terms.
You encode plans as triplets of the form (event, condition, operation), where "event" is the goal to be pursued, "condition" is a FOL formula to be tested against the current beliefs, and "operation" is a list of activities to be performed to pursue "goal".
Operations can either be further sub-goals, or primitive actions.
Primitive actions are again FOL terms, which are interpreted as function (with actual arguments) that the agent may invoke to do act on the environment (or on itself).

Below is a representation of your internal state.
For each item of the state, both the FOL syntax and the natural language interpretation are provided.
